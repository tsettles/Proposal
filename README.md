# Sound Orchestrating Table 
## Proposal

##### Summary:

	Patterns are unique. Rhythms, paths, and waves of information construct the base of our interactive Knowledge. I aim to create a table with an interactive topographic table top that eplores rythym in sound and the pattern of potential outcomes. The table top panels afford to slide in and out of the table top’s 12 slots. Each panel matches up or is visually discoverable, either when it is in an ordered and accurate fashion or when it is disorganized. The sound of music is the table top’s interactive inspiration. Here, the mountains literally sing! I plan on programming each panel with a specific sound by using (an RFID tag that runs the contact and puts off its respective sound). My vision is to see someone orchestrating new songs by rearranging the order of the panels, discovering the paired tone and physical pattern of each panel.  A person is able to hear the sound of each panel by fully inserting it into any slot. The person can play back their ordered arrangement by pressing an on and off button located on a curb of the table top. There will also be a secondary on/off button that plays back the arrangement, but this time in a random order and positioned on the curb adjacent to the other button. 

##### Component parts:

- A finished table

- Wooden panels

- A 13.56MHz RFID/NFC Clear Tag - 1KB  (A purchasable item)

- On/off button (A purchasable item)

##### Challenges:

	I may have difficulties with the execution of the physical work. Sensors might not be the correct length for the slots and the sensors may not connect to each other given the width of the table (18 inches). I’m also not very sure how to tell the on/off buttons to turn a whole other set of sensors on and off (How to physically connect the two?).
